Observation: To achieve a fully functional HAProxy endpoint for the Kubernetes API Server that supports multi-master joins, several design choices and compromises were necessary. The configuration uses TCP passthrough only, without SSL termination on HAProxy, ensuring that kubeadm and other clients see the real certificates of the masters. Healthchecks are limited to simple TCP checks on port 6443, meaning HAProxy only verifies that the port is open and does not validate the API Server health beyond connectivity. Round-robin load balancing is used, which is stable but does not account for actual load or server performance. Logging is directed to stdout for audit purposes, and no internal inspection of HTTPS traffic is performed. These decisions prioritize compatibility, stability, and auditability over advanced health monitoring or TLS inspection.
